# Progress

Append-only log. Newest entry at the bottom; never edit past entries.

## 2026-10-06: Project setup

- Reviewed the PRD draft and changed two locked decisions: the app runs entirely on the Android phone
  (no Node companion, no PWA) and is built natively in Kotlin + Jetpack Compose.
- Login moves to an in-app WebView that reads Instagram's cookies; pasting `sessionid` stays as a fallback.
- Added `.gitignore` (Android/Gradle plus session and secret patterns), a project `CLAUDE.md`, and these docs.
- Found the GitHub repo is public; flagged to the owner.

## 2026-10-06: Design approved and spec written

- Brainstormed the design section by section with the owner and wrote it up in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-saved-reels-android-design.md`.
- New decisions: video streams on demand into a `pk`-keyed LRU cache; unsaves and collection moves are mirrored
  only by a manual Full sync; sync is manual-only through WorkManager; the session is checked per sync, not
  per app start.
- Safety model: one strictly sequential Pacer (4–12 s gaps, breaks, 300 per run, 600 per rolling 24 h), zero
  retries on challenges, escalating cooldowns on rate limits, and deletion only after a complete walk.
- An adapter spike on the owner's phone (M3) confirms endpoints, headers and `saved_collection_ids` before
  the real parsers are written.

## 2026-10-06: M0–M2 plan written

- 18-task TDD plan for M0 (skeleton, secret guard), M1 (full app on the fake backend) and M2 (WebView login,
  paced session validation); M3–M6 get their own plans after the M3 spike.
- Spec amended to match: `SessionProbe` split and `reportsSavedCollectionIds` on the adapter contract,
  progress columns on `sync_run`, one numbering scheme for quick and full walks, a separate fake-backend
  Pacer, and SDK level 36.

## 2026-10-06: M0 skeleton

- Two-module Gradle build (AGP 9.4.1 built-in Kotlin, Kotlin 2.4.20, Gradle 9.8.0); `./gradlew check` green.
- Backup and device transfer disabled, with a test that checks every domain is excluded.
- Pre-commit secret guard with a self-test script.
